# Execution ledger appender - the only writer of a project's rail ledger.
#
# Why this exists: a status page updated by hand drifts from the work it claims to show. One script
# writes the ledger row and prints the same text, so the line pasted to the owner and the recorded
# row can never disagree. The page is built from this file and from nothing else.
#
# BREADCRUMB - why the environment variables are RAIL_*, not RIME_*.
# What broke: the upstream copy of this script (~/.claude/skills/execution-rail/bin/ledger.sh, line 10)
#   defaulted its ledger path to one specific investigation directory. A project that called it without
#   exporting the variable appended its rows to that other project's ledger.
# Why that mattered: the ledger is the sole source the page renders from. A row in the wrong file never
#   appears on the right page, and a foreign row corrupts the other project's record at the same time -
#   two broken records from one missing export, with no error at any point.
# Why this fix: the vendored copy takes RAIL_LEDGER with no default at all and refuses to run without it,
#   so the failure is a message at the first call instead of silent corruption discovered later.
#   Rejected: keeping the default and documenting the export, which is the arrangement that already failed.
# Cost: every caller must set RAIL_LEDGER. report/rail.sh does it, so no human ever types it.
#
# Usage: ledger.sh <step> <started|complete|blocked|issue|question|checkpoint> "<text, 15 words max>" [ref]
#        ledger.sh --show [n]     print the last n rows (default 10)
