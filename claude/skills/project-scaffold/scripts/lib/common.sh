# BREADCRUMB - S-05 M1 (review: ~/.local/state/dotfiles/execution/S-05-review.md).
# What broke: log-issue.sh and backlog.sh retried only when ln met the exact
# same file name. The name carries the timestamp, so that retry fired only for
# the same second AND the same suffix; a suffix already held by an entry from
# any other second was minted again without a word. find_item then refused
# that ID for good (backlog.sh, "id_ambiguous") and check went red.
# Why that mattered: the suffix IS the ID. Its uniqueness across both trees is
# the one property every lookup depends on.
# Why this fix: look the suffix up in both trees before it is used, and re-mint
# on a hit. Rejected: trusting 36^5 - at about 3,000 entries the birthday odds
# of a collision are roughly 7 percent.
# Cost: one find over both trees per entry created. Two writers in different
# seconds that draw the same suffix inside the same instant still both pass
# the lookup; that needs a 1-in-60-million draw at the same moment, and check
# is the backstop that names it.
#
# BREADCRUMB - S-05 L5. What broke: with no readable /dev/urandom the mint came
# back short or empty and was written as-is; log exited 0 with a file name
# check rejects. Why this fix: validate the shape here, the one place every
# mint passes, and fail loud - a re-mint cannot help when the source is gone.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Migration. `log-issue.sh migrate` and `backlog.sh migrate` are one verb: each
# converts every monolith present - ISSUES.md, BACKLOG.md, or both - in one run.
#
# BREADCRUMB - S-05 H1 (review: ~/.local/state/dotfiles/execution/S-05-review.md).
# What broke: each script migrated its own monolith with its own old-ID map.
# log-issue.sh rewrote refs through the ISS map only and kept BK- tokens as they
# were, and backlog.sh overwrote its old IDs with the new suffixes, so the
# BK -> suffix map was thrown away. The old tool documented `--refs BK-014` as
# normal usage (main:scripts/log-issue.sh:29).
# Why that mattered: `check` rejects a BK- token as "not a 5-char suffix", and
# entries are immutable, so no sanctioned command could ever turn it green - a
# project with --ci went red and stayed red.
# Why this fix: one run, one map holding both ISS- and BK- keys, built before
# anything is written. Rejected: a map file left behind by the first migrate for
# the second to read, which is a second source of truth that outlives its use
# and still depends on the two runs happening in the right order.
# Cost: a project with only one monolith left (its other tree migrated by the
# old per-file tool) keeps its refs into that tree unmapped; check names them.
#
# BREADCRUMB - S-05 H2. What broke: timestamps were parsed during the write
# pass, one entry at a time, so a bad `logged:` on entry N stopped the run
# after N-1 files were written and with the monolith still in place. The rerun
# was refused as already_migrated and logging was refused because the monolith
# was there: stuck, with hand deletion the only way out.
# Why this fix: every value is parsed and checked before the first write, and
# every write and rename is recorded in the undo log, so a failure at any point
# leaves the project exactly as it was. Rejected: stage-then-rename-once, see
# the undo log's breadcrumb. Cost: none; the parse was already done in full.
