# WO-20261016-4794 - Test B21f2 - suite controller on main after the build merges

## Problem

The B21f2 build is proven only by its suite run on main, by a tester who did not write it (Design principles 101 item 30)

## Scope

**In**

_none_

**Out - non-goals**

- changing any code; a failing case is filed as a bug with its output

## Degrees of freedom

- [fixed] None declared: implement exactly as specified; raise a question before deviating.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `AC-H1` *(human)* every case in the plan passes on main, output captured to the artifact store (item 31)

## Test plan

_Test plan from claude/workflow/templates/test-plan.md, shaped by claude/workflow/schemas/test-plan.schema.json. The tester runs exactly these cases and nothing else._

**Scope under test**

run.json single writer and the new controller, seat status and clean records

**Cases**

- `TP-1`
  - intent: a run file rewritten by four scripts cannot be migrated or trusted mid-run
  - command: `podman run --rm --network=none --userns=keep-id -v "$PWD:/work:ro,Z" -w /work/claude/workflow/inbox-sweep -e HOME=/tmp localhost/dotfiles-workflow-test:1 bash tests/run.sh --suite controller`
  - expected: exit 0; the output ends with `ok  controller` and `ran 1 suite`; the byte-identical run.json case is ok

**Isolation**

- runtime: podman
- image: `localhost/dotfiles-workflow-test@sha256:0a6832bb348572415fc3b304ed48ece90bcce4bd92b7f3f95a6ebc9d694f18f0` (localhost/dotfiles-workflow-test:1 at cut time, built from claude/workflow/tests/container/Containerfile)

**Out of scope - CI covers**

- lint and every other suite

## Assumptions

_none_

## Open questions

_none_

## Notes

_Newest first. Appended only by `work-order note` - never by hand._

## Outcome

_Written by `work-order done`. Empty until then._
